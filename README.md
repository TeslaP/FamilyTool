# FamilyTool

An open-source, local-first personal finance awareness tool.

No subscriptions. No cloud lock-in. No data harvesting. Your finances stay on your machine, fully under your control.

FamilyTool replaces paid finance apps with a customisable, self-hosted alternative that combines practical transaction management with guided monthly reflection — called **Horizon Sessions**.

Everything is open source (AGPL-3.0), fully customisable, and actively maintained. The goal: a personal finance tool you actually own, that helps you understand your financial life without pressure or gamification.

## Why This Exists

Most personal finance tools are either:
- **Subscription SaaS** — paying monthly for basic budgeting
- **Bank apps** — limited, non-customisable, designed for engagement
- **Spreadsheets** — powerful but high-maintenance

FamilyTool is the third option: **open source software you run locally.** Import your bank exports, let AI categorise them, review what happened, reflect on the month. No recurring cost, no vendor dependency, no limits on customisation.

It's built for people who want financial awareness without paying for it — and who value owning their data completely.

---

## Philosophy

Most finance software is designed around tracking, optimisation, and behavioural nudging. FamilyTool takes a different approach.

It treats financial review as a calm monthly practice:
- observational rather than judgemental
- reflective rather than reactive
- operational without feeling corporate

The product rhythm:

```
Import transactions
→ review what happened
→ reflect on the month
→ leave a note for the future
→ continue next month with memory and context
```

---

## Horizon Sessions

An optional guided reflection mode layered on top of the operational finance tool.

```
Dashboard → "Reflect on this month →"
→ Entry (greeting + intention)
→ Processing (settling in)
→ Notable transactions (grounding)
→ AI-generated reflection
→ Closing note
→ Return to dashboard
```

Sessions are calm, observational, non-judgemental. Not productivity coaching, not budgeting pressure, not wellness language.

The AI reflection references trends across months, previous session notes, and user intentions — creating financial memory over time.

## Features

### Local-first
- SQLite storage, data stays on your machine
- No cloud sync, works offline
- Pre-import backups

### Transaction Import
- `.TAB`, `.TXT`, `.XLS` bank exports (ABN AMRO format)
- Upload → Preview → Confirm wizard
- Duplicate detection, rule matching
- AI categorisation runs in background (child process)

### AI Categorisation
- OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) with Dutch banking context
- Transfer detection (own accounts, credit cards, investments)
- Rule learning from corrections
- ~400 pre-seeded rules from historical data (90%+ auto-categorisation)
- Confidence scoring, cached results
- Graceful fallback without API key

### Dashboard
**Overview** — calm monthly reflection:
- Hero metric with count-up animation
- Temporal reflection (scope-adaptive note for the period)
- Category spending grid
- Session reflection display
- Entry point to Horizon Sessions

**Detail** — scrollable operational report:
- Monthly metrics
- Temporal reflection block (adapts depth to selected timeframe)
- Weekly pacing (runway awareness)
- Category + merchant breakdowns
- Year trajectory (savings progress, YoY spending)
- AI observations with category anomaly detection

### Weekly Pacing
Reframes budgeting as runway awareness. "How is this month unfolding?" rather than "You are over budget."

### Year Trajectory
Longitudinal view: savings progress, investment pacing, year-over-year spending. Designed to feel like an energy report, not a trading dashboard.

### Review
- Spreadsheet-style table with inline dropdowns
- Toggle: "Needs review" / "All transactions"
- Bulk assign, confirm, delete
- Save corrections as rules
- Review badge in sidebar

### Forecast
- Fixed vs variable cost projection
- Period selector: 1 month / 3 months / Till EOY
- Editable line items, live recalculation

### Calendar
- Month selector with dropdown grid + year navigation
- Presets: This month, Last month, Last 3/6 months, Year to date, Calendar year
- Range highlighting, chevrons navigate from range end
- Selection persists across pages (shared context)

---

## Visual Design

- **Palette:** Warm Stone & Paper (Tailwind `stone` scale, seasonal tint)
- **Typography:** Inter (UI) + Newsreader (reflection/editorial)
- **Navigation:** Compact icon rail with tooltips
- **Login:** Seasonal nature photography, staggered entrance animation
- **Motion:** Unified system — micro(200ms) / section(600ms) / atmospheric(1200ms)
- **Logo:** Horizon mark (circle with layered landscape lines)
- **Transitions:** 400ms blur threshold entering Session mode

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeslaP/FamilyTool.git
cd FamilyTool
npm install
```

### Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=your-password
JWT_SECRET=change-this

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

DB_PATH=./data/familytool.sqlite

AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
AI_SUMMARY_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

OpenAI is optional. The app works without it — transactions remain uncategorised until manually reviewed.

### Restore Sample Data (optional)

Pre-categorised transactions (no API calls needed):

```bash
cd server && npx tsx restore-sample-db.ts
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

```

Key architectural decisions:
- Prompt registry: separate prompts per purpose (categorise, reflect, analyse)
- AI import: detached child process (`categorise-pending.ts`)
- Session mode: orchestration layer, same data, different emotional container
- Month state: React context shared across pages
